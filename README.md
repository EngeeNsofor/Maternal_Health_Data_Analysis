# Maternal Health Data Analysis

### Context
The health of women throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period is referred to as maternal health. Despite significant advancement over the past 20 years, 
295,000 women died during or after pregnancy and childbirth in 2017. This number is unacceptably high. In addition to indirect factors including anaemia, and malaria, the 
most frequent direct causes of maternal injury and death are excessive blood loss, infection, and high blood pressure. Most maternal deaths are preventable with timely 
management by skilled professionals working together across different disciplines. 

### Objective
As a data scientist working alongside clinicians, this project aims to analyze maternal health data, and identify evidence based actions with an aim to improve health outcomes.  

### Data

**DiastolicBP** - Diastolic Blood Pressure reading in mmHg (lower blood pressure value)  
**BS** - Blood Sugar level in mmol/L  
**BodyTemp** - Body Temperature reading  
**HeartRate** - Heart Rate reading in beats per minute  
**RiskLevel** - Risk Level rating (high, low and mid)
